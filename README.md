# Revert-YT-UI-Change
A userscript that aims to revert Youtube's recent UI change

V4 is much more extensive than V3, with detailed adjustments for font size, the clipped off control bar, video window size, and I fixed the rate limiting.

V3 may still be more lightweight, so try that out if you encounter any performance issues (though I really don't think that should be an issue). Or, try adjusting the rate limit.

Future version (Possibly): easier customization with instructions and easily settable variables.
